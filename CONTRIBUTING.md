6. This project uses `prettier` for code formatting, kindly run this formatter before pushing any changes
   - To run the formatter, install the `prettier` extension and set it as default formatter
   - Now use manual `format document with` option or turn on `format on save` option to automatically format files when saved
   - Alternatively, install `prettier cli` ([instructions here](https://prettier.io/docs/en/cli.html)) and use command `prettier --write src` to format files with single command
