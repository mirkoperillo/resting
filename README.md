Resting is a rest client WebExtension actually available for Firefox.

It is a very young project under an heavy development.

## Mission
The mission of Resting is to simplify daily work of developer in testing and analyzing HTTP/REST requests.

Resting takes inspiration from Postman with the goal to be light and focused on the management of saved requests.

## Privacy
Data is yours.
Resting doesn't save in any servers data about the APIs you invoke or any other data about the usage of Resting.
Everything is stored offline on your device, all the data is saved locally in the Indexed DB of your browser.

## Roadmap
This is the road to Resting v2.0

- [ ] Support file uploading [#53](https://github.com/mirkoperillo/resting/issues/53)
- [ ] Complete Oauth2.0 authentication [#110](https://github.com/mirkoperillo/resting/issues/110)
- [ ] Headers completion suggestion [#52](https://github.com/mirkoperillo/resting/issues/52)
- [ ] List available context variables fo the request [#114](https://github.com/mirkoperillo/resting/issues/114)

## Tech Stack
* Knockout.js 3.x: MVVM framework
* Bootstrap 3.x: UI framework
* highlight.js: response highlighter
* localforage: storage manager
* JQuery 3.x:  essentially used to perform http requests

## Principles
Resting tries to follow these principles:
* KISS and YAGNI, trying to maintain project light in code and libraries
* Keep the focus on result: the development cycle is composed by two steps: the first takes deliberately technological debt to ship features in a quick way, the second applies a phase of refactor to maintain the code clean.

The project follows the semantic versioning

## License

Resting is released under GPL v3 license after commit [117e15a33e97bc9c0905139ca527398e77e79620](https://github.com/mirkoperillo/resting/commit/117e15a33e97bc9c0905139ca527398e77e79620)

Resting was released under MIT license until [v1.0.2](https://github.com/mirkoperillo/resting/releases/tag/1.0.2)

### Why I changed license

I know Resting will never be a breakdown project, it is only a personal project and so the license change is only an ethical-political action.

I created Resting to solve my needs and to help users with needs like mine. My intent is to create a little community of users and contributors around the project to grow it up andÂ so I want the project to stay free and accessible forever even when I will be no longer the main maintainer.
